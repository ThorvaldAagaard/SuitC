# SuitC

**SuitC** analyses bridge suit combinations. Given the cards North and South
hold in one suit, it finds the best way to play the suit, assuming North-South
know only their own cards and the probability of each East-West distribution.
It does this for several objectives:

- the maximum expected number of tricks,
- safety plays: the best chance of making at least *n* tricks,
- the best play at **matchpoints** and at **IMPs**, including mixed strategies.

SuitC was written by **Gerrit A. van der Velde** (Leiden, the Netherlands). Its
roots go back about 25 years, to his earlier program ExpertPlay. Gerrit's own
revision history from 2008 onwards is preserved in this repository; see
[HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md). SuitC is used by the bridge programs
[BEN](https://github.com/lorserker/ben), Lia and CCAnalyzer, through the
[SuitCWinLib](https://github.com/codescrut/SuitCWinLib) library.

With AQ2 opposite 543, the best line is: cash the ace, then lead towards the
queen. It wins two tricks 50.48 % of the time, and the expected number of tricks
is 1.5048. [docs/output.md](docs/output.md) explains how to read the game tree.

## Getting SuitC

Pre-built programs for Linux (x64, arm64), macOS (arm64, x64) and Windows
(x64) are attached to each [release](../../releases).

To build from source you need a C compiler and CMake 3.21 or newer:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release      # optional: run the regression tests
```

The programs are written to `build/` (`build/Release/` with Visual Studio).
Gerrit's original Makefiles in `src/`, `dds/` and `playc/` still work on Linux,
macOS, Cygwin and WSL. See [docs/building.md](docs/building.md) for details.
