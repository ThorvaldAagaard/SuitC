# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## Project

SuitC is a bridge suit combination analyser by Gerrit A. van der Velde
(Leiden). It is plain C with no dependencies beyond the standard library.
The repository also holds dds (a multi-layout double-dummy solver), playc (a
suit combination enumerator), Gerrit's database scripts (bash/Perl), examples
and documentation. See README.md and docs/.

The git history up to Rev 2.020 was reconstructed from Gerrit's RCS archives.
Those commits are authored by him and carry an `RCS-History-Id` trailer. Do
not rewrite them.

## Build and test

```sh
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

- CMake works on Linux, macOS and Windows (MSVC). Gerrit's own Makefiles in
  `src/`, `dds/` and `playc/` must keep working too (`mkdir -p bin; cd src; make`).
- `extern.h` is generated from `global.h` (CMake: in the build dir; Makefiles:
  next to the sources). Never edit or commit `extern.h`; edit `global.h`.
- `tests/cases.txt` lists the regression cases; `tests/expected/*.out` is
  the output of Rev 2.020, identical on gcc, clang and MSVC. Any change not
  meant to alter the analysis must keep every test passing. Regenerate the
  expected output with `cmake -DSUITC=<binary> -P tests/update_expected.cmake`
  only for intended changes of results.

## Code conventions

- One C function per `.c` file, named after the function.
- All state is global and declared in `global.h`. `header.h` holds the
  types, macros and pool sizes (`NNODES`, `NINDICES`, `NQUIRKS`).
- `COLOR` is an `unsigned short` card bit mask; `addcard(c)` sets a bit and
  `low_c(c)` isolates the lowest one. Players: `west=0, north=1, east=2, south=3`.
- Memory comes from pre-allocated pools with bump allocation, not
  malloc/free per item.
- `SUITCAPP` (compile-time, `YES`/`NO`) selects the reduced output used when
  SuitC is embedded in other applications.
- Match Gerrit's style: 4-space indentation, `//` comments, spaces inside
  parentheses.
